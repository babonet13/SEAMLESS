Introduction
-
Each of us, for __different and varied reasons__ (e.g. competitive watch, market survey, product watch, market watch, technological watch, entrepreneurial approach, product development, ...) are led to "map", __more or less formally__ (and using __more or less adapted__ tools), the environment in which we are currently evolving (or the one in which we wish to evolve in the future) !

Indeed, mapping your environment allows you to have a global and precise vision of it...   
... in order to be able to better act on it.

The E2M model (Ecosytem Mapping Model) aims to meet this need by proposing :
* A methodological approach
* A model (declined according to different formalisms)
* Proposals for target tools (depending on required functions and usage)

Problem to be solved
-
Environments may be potentially __very different__ from one case to another, but it turns out that the questions we ask about them, but also the concepts that *structure* these environments are - globally - always the __same__ (they are in a way the *business variables* of the "ecosystem mapping" knowledge domain).

In fact, when one tries to __apprehend an ecosystem__, one tries __essentially__ to answer the following questions: 
* WHAT?
* Does WHAT?
* HOW?
* For WHAT?
* And WHY?

[Questions](https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/images/Who-DoesWhat-How-ForWhat-Why.png)

It is obviously possible to ask other very relevant questions about its environment, but the perimeter of E2M is - for the moment - limited to these 5 questions ;-)

Methodological approach
-
The methodological approach for proposing the E2M model is mainly based on distinguishing in each thing that must be identified in the "map" (in order to be able to relate it to other elements) : 
* on the one hand its "intention" (a notion that refers to the reason why the thing must be identified)
* on the other hand its "extension" (a notion that refers to the nature of the thing)

An article describing this approach in more detail "Intention VS Extension" is available <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/ReasonWhyA2-LevelModel_EN.md">here</a>.

Experience shows that globally, __intention is more important than extension__, and that often models are "polluted" by the extension of things (when they are designed in a too "monolithic" way). 

Managing these 2 notions in an "orthogonal" way (i.e. "independently", but in possible connection) makes it possible to have a more compact, more robust and more evolutive model, because it is based on 2 key modules :
* an "intensional" module which brings genericity and allows to address a large diversity of ecosystems.
* an "extensional" module that provides specificity and serves as a "root" for sub-modules to address particular ecosystems. 

Underlying Semantics
-
A <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/tree/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary">conceptionary</a> allows to describe the concepts used by E2M   
(Work in progress ...)_

The simplified conceptual model allows to visualize "large mesh" relationships between intentional and extensional concepts:

Desired features
-
Making such a map requires - ideally - to be able to rely on 2 functional modes that are diametrically opposed, but totally complementary. They are the following modes:
* "Model-Driven" mode
* "Model-Discovery" mode 

Note: The 2nd mode, requires - again ideally - a reconciliation mode in addition to

More information on these functional modes <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/4_Functionalities/FunctionalModes.md">on this page</a>

Corresponding Ontologies
-
The E2M model is available for the following 3 formalisms ...   
... and adapted for some tools :
